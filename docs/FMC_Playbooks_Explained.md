# FMC Ansible Playbooks Explained

## What is FMC (Firewall Management Center)?

**FMC (Firewall Management Center)** is Cisco's centralized management platform for their Firepower security devices. Think of it as the "control tower" for your network security infrastructure. It allows network administrators to:

- Configure firewall rules and policies
- Monitor network traffic and threats
- Manage multiple firewall devices from one location
- Generate security reports and analytics
- Troubleshoot network connectivity issues

## Overview of the Automation Suite

This Ansible project provides automated tools to manage and monitor your FMC system. Instead of manually clicking through the FMC web interface, these playbooks use API calls to perform tasks automatically, saving time and reducing human error.

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**
The automation suite follows a modular design with:
- **Master Orchestrator** (`main.yml`) - Coordinates all automation tasks
- **Individual Playbooks** - Specialized tools for specific functions
- **Centralized Configuration** - All settings managed in `group_vars/all.yml`
- **Organized Output Structure** - Separate directories for configs, reports, logs, and traces

**Note:** The main.yml playbook is designed to use modular task files (e.g., `test_connection_tasks.yml`, `hardening_extraction_tasks.yml`, etc.) for better organization. If these task files don't exist yet, you can run the individual playbooks directly or create the task files by extracting the relevant tasks from each individual playbook.
